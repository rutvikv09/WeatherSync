# WeatherSync
This project explores **full-stack development and near-real-time data processing** using **Kappa Architecture**, integrating **OpenWeather APIs, Kafka, Spark, Cassandra, Spring Boot, and Angular**. It focuses on learning **cloud computing, streaming data architectures, and API management** rather than analyzing weather data itself.
